"""SWOTxAI evolve candidate.

CONTRACT — the harness calls exactly this function; keep the signature:

    train_and_predict(X_train, Y_train, X_test, params) -> np.ndarray

  X_train : float32 (n_train, d) feature matrix; may contain NaN (stencil
            padding at swath edges).
  Y_train : float32 (n_train, 2) targets (u, v) in m/s; NaN marks an invalid
            component (train on the valid entries only).
  X_test  : float32 (n_test, d).
  params  : dict with keys:
              seed          - int, seed all RNGs with this
              device        - "cuda" or "cpu"
              max_epochs    - int, do not train longer than this many epochs
              time_budget_s - float, soft wall-clock budget for training

  Returns predictions for X_test, shape (n_test, 2), finite everywhere.

Everything below the contract may be rewritten freely. Allowed imports:

    """Standardize, gradient-fill missing stencil cells, append missingness,
    spatial std, and explicit per-feature spatial derivatives (first and
    second order).

    Feature-major layout: column f * n_cells + c is feature f at stencil
    cell c, so reshaping to (n, F, C) groups each feature's spatial
    neighborhood. Ingredients:
      * per-cell missing fraction (n, C) — lets the net distinguish
        swath-edge padding from a genuinely calm/average ocean state, in 9
        columns instead of the parent's 72 binary flags (the per-feature
        flags within a cell are perfectly collinear anyway, since padding
        truncates whole cells);
      * per-feature stencil standard deviation (n, F), computed on the
        standardized values over VALID cells only — an explicit front/eddy
        intensity signal. Rows with a single valid cell get std 0;
      * gradient-preserving imputation: a missing stencil cell at offset
        (di, dj) from the center is filled with 2*center - mirror, where
        mirror is the cell at (-di, -dj) — the first-order Taylor (constant
        local gradient) continuation of the field. Swath-edge padding
        truncates one SIDE of the neighborhood, so the mirror cell is
        usually valid; zero-fill (the parent's scheme) flattened the
        neighborhood to "locally mean", erasing exactly the gradient signal
        edge rows need — the parent's widest diagnostic gap. Extrapolated
        fills are clamped to +/-4 standardized sigma; where the mirror is
        itself missing the fill falls back to the center value, and rows
        whose center is NaN fall back to the mean (0 after standardization)
        via the final nan_to_num. The missingness block still marks which
        cells were padded, so the model can discount imputed structure;
      * per-feature central differences (n, 2F): gx = (right - left)/2 and
        gy = (down - up)/2 across the stencil, computed AFTER imputation.
        These are the finite-difference operators a stencil CNN would learn
        as 3x3 kernels — the along/across-track gradients of SSH and the
        geostrophic velocity components, whose cross-feature linear combos
        are shear, strain, divergence and vorticity, i.e. the front/eddy
        dynamics behind the fast-regime deficit (proven in lineage);
      * per-feature second-order operators (n, 3F): the 5-point Laplacian
        (left + right + up + down - 4*center) and the two diagonal central
        differences (NE - SW)/(2*sqrt(2)) and (NW - SE)/(2*sqrt(2)). The
        Laplacian of SSH is proportional to geostrophic relative vorticity
        (zeta = g/f * lap(eta)) — the eddy signal itself — and the diagonal
        gradients complete the local deformation/strain tensor that
        axis-aligned differences cannot resolve. Because the mirror
        imputation is Taylor-LINEAR, filled cells satisfy
        filled + mirror - 2*center = 0, so at swath edges the second
        differences collapse toward zero — a conservative "no measured
        curvature" default rather than amplified edge noise.
